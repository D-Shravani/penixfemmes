        Violence against women (VAW), also known as gender-based violence and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) are violent acts primarily or exclusively committed by men or boys against women or girls. Such violence is often considered a form of hate crime, committed against women or girls specifically because they are female, and can take many forms. 
        
        VAW has a very long history, though the incidents and intensity of such violence have varied over time. Violence against women may arise from a sense of entitlement, superiority, misogyny or similar attitudes in the perpetrator or his violent nature, especially against women. 
        
        Some terrifying stats: 
        Across their lifetime, 1 in 3 women experience a form of violence in their lifetime. 
        On average more than three women a day are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends in the United States. 
        One in five women are sexually assaulted in college. 
        A woman who has suffered a strangulation incident is 750% more likely to be killed by the same perpetrator. 
        Four out of every five stalking victims are women.

      <h3>2.Safety Tips: </h3>
      <p>1) Have a Plan 
        When you are going out, whether it be alone or with a group of friends, it is best to have a plan in place. Knowing your surroundings, such as who and what is in the immediate area, is one of the most crucial safety tips to remember. Making a habit to pay attention to what is going on around you will help you become more aware of your environment. In addition, as an extra level of precaution, let someone outside of your group know your whereabouts and what you have planned for the day/evening. 
       <p></p> 2) Ping Your Location 
        Smartphones are not only a great tool for taking photos, sending messages, and sharing news, but they can also be lifesavers. Most smartphones have a great emergency feature that allows users to ping their location to anyone in their contact list. This feature is easy to setup and will draw attention to the user should they find themselves in an unsafe situation. 
    </p>
    <p>3) Tools for protection
        When it comes to selecting a self-defense device, it is important to choose one you feel most comfortable carrying. Items such as pepper spray, a safety whistle, and a mini flashlight, are great options to have on hand when going out. 
    </p>
    <p>4) Create Boundaries 
        Regardless if you are out alone or with a group of friends, if you ever feel uncomfortable or unsafe with someone’s attention toward you, do not be afraid to put distance between yourself and the individual. There is nothing rude about protecting yourself in a potentially unsafe situation. At the end of the day, always remember to follow your instinct!  
    </p>
    <p>  5) Take a self-defense class 
        Turn safety into fun and try a class in self-defense! We never want to think the worst could happen. However, in terms of learning to protect oneself in a potentially dangerous situation, being equipped physically and mentally handle those scenarios is key. 
    </p>
    <p>  6) Buddy up 
        Do your best to not walk alone. The more the merrier in the terms of safety! 
    </p>
    <p> 7) Avoid oversharing on social media. 
        While sharing your location can be good in situations when you need someone else to know where you are, it can also let criminals know when you are not at home.  Posting your location, travel plans and details about your home layout on social media can make it easy for people to know exactly how and when to break into your home. 
    </p>
    <p> 8) Update your friends or family. 
        Let your friends or family know where you’re going and that you’ll be alone. Giving them updates along the way will give the both of you peace of mind. 
    </p>
    <p> 9) Tell someone you got home safe. 
        Tell a friend or family member to expect a text message from you when you get home and what to do if they don’t hear from you.</p>

      <h3>3.Legal Laws and resources:</h3>
      <p>CRIME AGAINST WOMEN</p>

      <p>  The analysis on non- marital sexual violence in India is led by Center for Gender Equity and Health, University of California, in collaboration with Mumbai based International Institute for Population Sciences, concludes non marital sexual violence is a “ pervasive concern” affecting the greater number of women and adolescents than reported cases suggest. Most assailants are known to the victims, as partners, family members or friends. Strangers perpetrated sexual violence against is less common. 
        
        Sexual harassment is not about sex, it is about inequality at work, about erasing a women’s worth, her mind, her competence and reducing her to a body. The harms of sexual harassment, and the scale of it, have been made abundantly clear to everyone. The women being heard now have a certain visibility and influence. They are guaranteed to be heard by the Law, media and social media.
        
        The women’s movement has been building strength, deepening and diversifying for decades. The quest for justice zigs and zags – Bhanwari Devi, the Rajasthani social worker who was gangraped, is still to get justice, but because of her, Indian women now have a law against sexual harassment at work place. The Nirbhaya moment may have gone, but the constituency it mobilised remains awake and vigilant. More women are speaking up, boosting each other’s signal, pushing back against the norms, giving precise words to male entitlement.
        
        The Supreme Court affirmed that the human rights of a girl child are very much alive and kicking whether she is married or not and deserve recognition and acceptance.
        
         “Suhanubhav Foundation” another step in this direction, will provide free Legal aid for women and create awareness to make society safer for women and stand up & speak for women’s rights.

        <p>5.    Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956
        
        In 1956 India passed the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act, 1956 (SITA). The act was further amended and changed in 1986, resulting in the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act also known as PITA which only discusses trafficking in relation to prostitution and not in relation to other purposes of trafficking such as domestic work, child labour, organ harvesting, etc. 
        
        The act defines child as any person who has completed eighteen years of age. 
        
        The Act outline the illegality of prostitution and the punishment for owning a brothel or a similar establishment, or for living of earnings of prostitution as is in the case of a pimp.
        
        If a person procures, induces or takes a child for the purpose of prostitution then the prison sentence is a minimum of seven years but can be extended to life. Any person involved in the recruiting, transporting, transferring, harbouring, or receiving of persons for the purpose of prostitution if guilty of trafficking or attempting to commit trafficking or found in the brothel or visiting the brothel is punishable under this law. If a child is found in a brothel and after medical examination has been found to have been sexually abused, it is assumed that the child has been detained for the purpose of prostitution. 
        
        Any person committing prostitution in public with a child shall be punishable to seven year in prison up to life imprisonment, or a term which may extend to ten year and also a maximum fine of one lakh rupees. If prostitution of a child is being committed with knowledge of an establishment owner such as a hotel the license of the hotel is likely to be cancelled along with the given prison sentence and/or fines. 
        
        In 2006, the Ministry of Women and Child Development proposed an amendment bill that has yet to be passed. The amendment does not really concern any of the provisions related to the child but has many important consequences for the right of women sex workers.</p>
